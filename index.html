                            I just want you to know that I love you so, so much, and you have made me the happiest person. I'm forever grateful that you're here with me. I know we've been through a lot and have almost separated several times, but look at us, we still manage to celebrate this special day together. I'm really proud of both of us! I promise I will continue working on being better for you, and always remember that, no matter what happens, I'm always here. I love you so much!
